# Data Mining Projects
This repository contains the high-level overview of all the projects (assignments) of the graduate level course, INF 553, which I have taken at USC (Spring 2020). The course instructor was Prof. Wei-Min Shen.

The goal of the course was to familiarise students with large scale data mining problems on a variety of data sources. The following are some of the algorithms which I have implemented in Apache Spark.

<ul>
  <li>SON (Savasere, Omiecinski & Navathe) Algorithm: to find frequent itemsets (a variation of Apriori algorithm)</li>
  <li>Locality Sensitive Hashing: to find similarity between large itemsets in one pass (by hashing repeatedly)</li>
  <li>Collaborative filtering: traditional recommendation system</li>
  <li>Girvan-Newman algorithm: to detect communities in a social network</li>
  <li>Streaming algorithms: bloom filtering, reservoir sampling and FM Algo</li>
  <li>BFR (Bradley, Fayyad & Reina) Algorithm: similar to K-Means, but applied on disk-resident data</li>
</ul>

Note: The reason I am not sharing the code is because I have to honour the code of conduct of the University. It will only be available upon request to potential employers who want to assess my capabilities in similar domains. If you want to look at the code, email me at: aditya.chandupatla@gmail.com
